# PolicyEngine Strategy Overview

## Vision and Mission

**PolicyEngine** is building a comprehensive, open-source platform to **democratize policy analysis**. Most advanced policy models today are proprietary or costly, but PolicyEngine “enables anyone to compute the fiscal and distributional impacts of public policy” with free, transparent tools. By combining a detailed tax-benefit rules engine, rich microdata, and user-friendly web interfaces, the goal is to make sophisticated policy analysis accessible to all – from researchers and policymakers to journalists and everyday citizens. In short, PolicyEngine strives to be an **indispensable public resource** for evidence-based policy design and evaluation, in the U.S., U.K., and beyond.

## Data and Modeling Roadmap

Over the next three years, PolicyEngine plans major enhancements to its **data and modeling capabilities** to capture a wider array of policies and behavioral dynamics:

- **Granular Geographic Modeling:** Building on recent state-level models for all 50 states, we will extend simulations to finer geographies. A current funded project is expanding U.S. analysis from states and congressional districts down to **state legislative districts and counties**, providing local-level estimates of policy impacts. This granularity will help identify regional disparities and benefit uptake gaps that nationwide models might miss. It also enables local policymakers and media to understand the **community-level effects** of national or state policies.

- **Longitudinal Panel Data:** We aim to develop a synthetic **75-year panel dataset** aligned with Social Security’s actuarial projections. This would track individuals over their lifetimes (e.g. earnings histories) to accurately simulate Social Security benefits and reforms. With such a longitudinal micro-dataset, PolicyEngine can project **lifetime impacts** of retirement and pension policy changes, addressing a capability gap in current tools.

- **Health Insurance Dynamics:** PolicyEngine already models programs like Medicaid, ACA subsidies, CHIP, and Medicare, but **employer coverage dynamics** are crucial for realistic health policy simulation. We plan to introduce **synthetic firm-level data** linking employees to employers, allowing simulation of policies that hinge on employer size or decisions (for example, insurance mandates for large employers). This will enable modeling of how employers adjust offerings and how workers sort across employer plans under reforms – an approach inspired by CBO’s HPSIM model for health insurance. Integrating firm and household data in one microsimulation is novel and will capture important **workplace incentives** and coverage dynamics that no open model currently addresses.

- **Overlapping Generations (OLG) and Macro Effects:** To complement micro-level analysis, we intend to develop an **OLG economic model** that can assess long-run growth and fiscal sustainability impacts. This means modeling how policies affect savings, investment, and capital accumulation across generations. For instance, adding a **corporate tax module** and linking it with household microsimulation would allow estimation of feedback effects on wages, output, and government revenue over time. By integrating a macro-growth component, PolicyEngine could provide **dynamic analysis** of policy changes (similar to models used in dynamic scoring), all within an open-source framework.

- **Fine-Grained Behavioral Simulation:** We are exploring cutting-edge AI techniques to enhance behavioral modeling at the individual level. One idea is using **large language models (LLMs)** to simulate decision-making by individual households in response to policy changes. In practice, each synthetic household could be paired with an AI agent that “responds” to a policy scenario (e.g. whether to work additional hours, take up a benefit, move locations under different tax regimes). These responses would be calibrated to empirical research (so that aggregate elasticities match literature values, for example) rather than relying on arbitrary AI output. Such an approach could provide more nuanced, heterogenous behavior patterns than traditional one-size-fits-all elasticity assumptions. It’s an ambitious research direction, but if successful, it would greatly enrich our micro-simulation with **realistic behavioral responses** at scale.

- **Additional Modeling Innovations:** We plan to expand environmental and housing policy modeling. For example, our UK model already includes a carbon tax scenario tool (showing revenue and distributional effects); a next step is integrating **emissions outcomes** into the simulation, so that users can see not only who pays a carbon tax but also how emissions might change as a result. In housing, we’re interested in simulating local **zoning and land-use policies** – e.g. how relaxing zoning rules or investing in housing affects affordability and household welfare. While modeling zoning impacts is complex, partnering with academics who study land use (some have already shown interest) could let us incorporate this dimension. These additions would move PolicyEngine beyond taxes and transfers into broader economic policy analysis.

Throughout these efforts, **open-source data science packages** we develop (like our `microimpute` tool for machine-learning imputation and `microcalibrate` for aligning microdata to targets) will play a key role. In fact, PolicyEngine has already demonstrated the power of these tools – for example, our `microimpute` Python package achieved **85%+ accuracy in wealth imputations** by using machine learning to merge survey datasets. Similarly, `microcalibrate` lets us reweight datasets to match thousands of aggregate targets, ensuring our simulations closely align with known totals (e.g. matching local benefit recipiency rates). These innovations improve the accuracy of PolicyEngine’s models and are themselves valuable contributions to the open-source ecosystem (usable by other researchers beyond microsimulation).

## Policy Coverage and Research Expansion

On the **policy content** side, PolicyEngine will broaden and deepen the range of policies it can simulate, with an emphasis on comprehensiveness across the tax-benefit spectrum and even public services:

- **Safety Net Programs:** We are expanding the model to include a wider array of benefit programs in all states. Currently, major programs like SNAP, Medicaid, and ACA subsidies are in place. Next, we plan to add or refine **TANF (cash welfare), CCDF (child care subsidies), LIHEAP (energy assistance)**, and other state-specific programs, ensuring each state’s unique rules are captured. Covering these programs nationwide will enable analysis of reforms to the social safety net and highlight gaps where eligible populations are not accessing benefits. In fact, having local-level simulations (down to counties) combined with these program rules will allow us to identify **geographic areas with low benefit take-up rates**, informing outreach or policy changes to improve program access.

- **Tax Policy Coverage:** In addition to federal and state income taxes (which are already modeled), we will incorporate other important tax policies. This includes **sales taxes and property taxes** at the state and local level – critical for understanding overall tax burdens. We also plan to model intergovernmental interactions like state-level tax credits or deductions tied to federal provisions. Moreover, a corporate/business tax module in the OLG model (mentioned above) would extend our analysis to business taxation and investment incentives. By having personal taxes, corporate taxes, and indirect taxes all in one framework, PolicyEngine can provide a truly holistic view of fiscal policy.

- **Public Services and Transfers:** Inspired by our UK work (supported by Nuffield Foundation) to include in-kind benefits and services, we aim to integrate programs like education spending, healthcare benefits (e.g. value of Medicaid/Medicare), and possibly housing subsidies. For example, our UK model is expanding to include all major childcare subsidies and public service spending at the household level. In the U.S., while direct public service valuation is complex, we could start with simulating childcare assistance programs or housing vouchers in our microsimulation. This aligns with making the model more comprehensive in representing government support beyond cash benefits.

- **Local Regulations and Other Policies:** In partnership with academic researchers, we’re exploring modeling certain **local policies** such as zoning laws or local minimum wage ordinances. These affect cost of living and economic opportunity but are rarely included in microsimulations. Even if these are initially prototype analyses (for specific cities or using external parameters), incorporating them would extend PolicyEngine’s usefulness for urban policy research. We also continue to maintain and update **environmental policy levers** (like carbon taxes or energy subsidies) so that distributional impacts of climate policies can be assessed alongside traditional fiscal policies.

- **Benefit Access Research:** With richer data on program eligibility and take-up, PolicyEngine will support research into improving benefit delivery. For instance, by simulating eligibility determination processes, we can analyze how different application procedures or questions affect drop-off. One practical product could be an **optimized question sequence** for benefit screeners: using our data on which factors most determine eligibility, we could suggest the minimal set of questions an applicant needs to answer to figure out their likely benefits. This kind of research and tooling can help government agencies or nonprofit services streamline enrollment, reduce friction, and ultimately increase uptake of programs among those who qualify.

PolicyEngine’s expanded policy coverage will be continuously **validated** and kept up-to-date. We plan to build an open validation dashboard (as done in the UK) to compare our output against other models and administrative data. By ensuring accuracy and transparency in how new policies are implemented in the model, we build trust with the policy research community. All these additions make the platform more useful for a **wider audience of policy analysts**, as noted by funders: PolicyEngine is already used by “think tanks, academics and parliamentarians,” and improving its comprehensiveness will further grow its capabilities and audience.

## Technology Platform Enhancements

To support the ambitious modeling and product goals, PolicyEngine will invest in a robust tech platform and user experience. Key technical initiatives include:

- **Unified Web Platform (PolicyEngine 2.0):** We are developing a new version of our web application with a more personalized, powerful interface. Users will be able to **save their inputs and simulation results** by creating accounts, enabling them to revisit scenarios or share them. The UI will allow complex policy scenario building (e.g. tweaking multiple parameters across tax and benefit programs) with intuitive controls and visualization of results (distributional charts, budget impacts, etc.). We will also introduce collaboration features – for instance, policy analysts in an organization can **comment on and refine scenarios together** within the platform. These features will cater to professional users (think tanks or legislative staff) who need to work in teams, which is something we could offer as part of a premium tier (discussed under sustainability).

- **API Improvements and Developer Tools:** PolicyEngine already offers an API that powers other applications (for example, our API drives tools like _MyFriendBen_ and _Benefit Navigator_). We plan to make this API more robust and easier to integrate, to attract a broader developer community. This means comprehensive documentation, software development kits (SDKs) or client libraries in multiple languages (Python, R, maybe JavaScript) so that everyone from academic researchers to fintech startups can plug PolicyEngine’s simulation engine into their projects. Enhancements will also include **greater scalability** – the ability to handle large batch requests (e.g. calculating results for every county or running thousands of household scenarios in parallel) – and flexible output formats for easy ingestion into other analysis pipelines.

- **Research Workbench and Notebooks:** To better serve power users (like economists and data scientists), we plan to create an integrated **PolicyEngine Workbench**. This could be a Jupyter notebook environment in the cloud pre-loaded with PolicyEngine data and libraries. Researchers would be able to write custom code (Python, R, etc.), run microsimulations, and directly generate reports or visualizations, all in one place. Crucially, this workbench would tie into our version-controlled policy rules, so analysts can cite exactly which policy parameters they used. It would also allow accessing **microdata outputs** for distributional analysis within the notebook, subject to privacy rules. Essentially, the workbench turns PolicyEngine into a _laboratory_ for policy analysis, lowering the technical overhead for outside researchers to run complex simulations and share their findings.

- **AI-Powered User Assistance:** We have already pioneered using AI to enhance user understanding of policy calculations. In late 2024 we launched an **AI explanation feature** that uses a large language model to translate complex tax-benefit calculations into plain English. For example, a user can click “Explain with AI” to get a step-by-step rationale of why they qualify (or not) for a credit or benefit, given all the intricate rules. The roadmap is to extend these AI capabilities further. In 2025, we are rolling out API access to the explanation system so that partner applications can also provide those explanations. Beyond explanations, we will experiment with AI for report generation – e.g. after running a simulation, the tool could draft a narrative summary of the results (which an analyst can then refine). We will ensure these AI features are used responsibly, focusing on **clarity and accuracy**, so they truly help users interpret results rather than confuse them. Overall, incorporating AI aligns with our goal of making policy analysis more accessible and user-centric.

- **Performance and Scalability:** As our models grow in complexity and usage, we need to maintain speed and reliability. We plan to implement **parallel processing** and other optimizations in our computation engine, so that even extremely detailed simulations (like a 75-year Social Security projection or a nationwide county-by-county analysis) can run in a reasonable time. We will also upgrade our cloud infrastructure for better scaling – e.g. auto-scaling clusters to handle peak loads (such as during a big policy announcement when many users might simulate alternatives). Additionally, a refactored database will serve as a **single source of truth** for all baseline data (demographic and economic inputs), ensuring consistency across the API, web app, and research tools. This will simplify maintenance and improve data update workflows (for example, when new census data or inflation forecasts come out, we can update one central database and all components use it).

- **Open-Source Ecosystem:** All of PolicyEngine’s software is open source, and we will continue to build in the open. This means our **GitHub repositories** (for the core engine, country-specific models, and utilities like microimpute) will remain active and welcoming to contributors. We are implementing more rigorous version control for policy rules – every change to a tax or benefit parameter is tracked and attributable – which not only aids transparency but also helps external developers trust the model. We plan to improve our test suites and continuous integration so that any contributions are automatically tested against known results, preserving accuracy. Finally, we will containerize and document our stack such that others can easily deploy their own instance or contribute code. By fostering a vibrant open-source community, we leverage collective expertise to build a more reliable, innovative platform.

## Target Users and Use Cases

PolicyEngine’s strategy centers on serving two broad groups of users: **policy analysts/researchers** and **benefit-access/customer-facing applications**, with increasing overlap between them.

- **Policy Researchers and Policymakers:** This group includes think tanks, academic institutions, government agencies, and legislative staff. They use PolicyEngine as a research and analysis tool to simulate policy proposals and understand impacts. In fact, PolicyEngine is _already_ being used by “think tanks, academics and parliamentarians” in the US and UK. We expect adoption here to grow as the platform’s capabilities expand. For example, U.S. Congressional staff (like those at the Joint Economic Committee) have begun exploring PolicyEngine for analyzing district-level impacts. Researchers at universities are contracting with us – e.g. Georgetown University and University of Michigan’s Better Government Lab are using our rules engine with administrative data to study benefit take-up, and University of Southern California economists are working with us to calculate comprehensive marginal tax rate schedules using PolicyEngine. Think tanks and advocacy groups can use the tool to score their policy proposals or to create interactive web features for public education. Even government bodies like the Census Bureau have shown interest (for instance, in using our engine to compute state tax liabilities in survey data). Our strategy is to deepen engagement with these users through partnerships, making sure PolicyEngine meets professional needs. This means providing reliability, support, and custom features (like bulk data processing or integration into their workflow) as needed. Ultimately, we want PolicyEngine to be a go-to resource for **evidence-based policy analysis** in the research and legislative community – much like CBO’s or Treasury’s models, but open to all.

- **Benefit Access Tools and Services:** A second critical user base consists of applications that help individuals understand and access benefits or make personal financial decisions. Rather than directly being policy analysts, these users leverage PolicyEngine’s API or engines under the hood. Notably, our API already powers innovative services like _MyFriendBen_ (an app for low-income families to identify eligible benefits) and _Benefit Navigator_ (a platform used by 500+ case managers in Los Angeles). The success of these tools – including MyFriendBen receiving a \$2.4 million Gates Foundation grant – shows the demand for high-quality benefit calculation engines. Going forward, we aim to broaden the API user base to other domains as well. This could include **personal finance and tax advisor apps** (e.g. tools that help people plan for tax changes or optimize their household finances could use PolicyEngine for detailed tax/benefit calculations). Even private-sector players like banks or consulting firms have interest – for example, analysts at Barclays reached out about using our software to understand the impacts of a major federal bill. We will market the API to such users by highlighting that integration can save them the effort of building complex tax-benefit logic from scratch. As our platform adds more features (like local-level detail and new programs), these client applications can offer more to their end-users (for instance, showing county-specific benefit info or simulating upcoming policy changes for a user’s situation). Serving this segment also aligns with our mission, because it ultimately helps **individuals and families gain access** to benefits and understand policy changes in their own lives.

- **Journalists and Public Discourse:** A growing use case is **media outlets and civic organizations** seeking localized or rapid analysis. With PolicyEngine’s expansion to local data, a reporter could quickly answer questions like “How would Proposal X affect typical families in our city?” or “What is the poverty impact of policy Y in this county compared to the neighboring county?”. We plan to engage with the media by providing easy-to-use tools or one-pagers for such analysis. Already, our work has begun to permeate public discussions – for example, PolicyEngine’s analysis was cited by a member of Congress during a bill introduction, and think tanks like the Niskanen Center have used our tools for their policy analysis. By empowering journalists and advocacy groups with data, we further our goal of a well-informed public debate. We envision offering training or “rapid response” support for partners in the media, especially as elections or major policy votes approach.

- **International and New Markets:** Currently, PolicyEngine operates in the US and UK. In the next few years, we see an opportunity to **expand to additional countries**, especially those with interest in open-source policy modeling. Canada is a logical next step – we have already made progress on Canadian tax/benefit rules, and could complete that with the right partnerships or funding. Other countries in Europe or elsewhere may follow, often in collaboration with local policy researchers who can validate country-specific details. By doing so under one umbrella (with a common technology core), we can share improvements across models – for example, a new feature built for the US might be easily applied to the UK or Canada. This expansion not only broadens our impact but could attract international funders or multilateral organizations interested in democratizing policy analysis globally. We will approach expansion opportunistically, focusing first on English-speaking or data-rich countries, and always ensuring local experts are involved to maintain credibility.

## Community and Partnerships

A vibrant **community and strong partnerships** are central to PolicyEngine’s strategy. As an open-source, mission-driven project, we place heavy emphasis on community building, collaboration, and outreach:

- **Open-Source Community Building:** We are actively cultivating an ecosystem of contributors and users around our open-source code. With support from programs like the National Science Foundation’s _Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems_ (for which we have a pending grant of \~\$300k), we plan to host **hackathons, workshops, and conferences** to bring people into the project. These events will train new users (e.g. how to write a policy reform analysis using PolicyEngine) and welcome new developers (e.g. how to contribute code or add a country’s tax system). We also intend to organize user symposiums and regular webinars to showcase use cases and gather feedback (much as we did in a recent joint webinar with Arnold Ventures on our SALT calculator). Building a community of practice around PolicyEngine will increase adoption and ensure the tool remains cutting-edge, as external contributors bring in fresh ideas. It will also help create an **open-source ecosystem** where related projects (for instance, specialized packages like microimpute, or spinoff tools) can thrive with shared knowledge.

- **Academic and Research Partnerships:** We leverage partnerships with academic institutions both to improve our models and to validate them. For example, our collaboration with Georgetown/Michigan on benefit take-up uses confidential administrative data to check PolicyEngine’s accuracy in identifying eligible non-participants – insights from that work will feed back into improving our simulations. Our contract with USC to map out marginal tax rate schedules is another example where academic rigor meets practical tool-building. We will seek more such partnerships, possibly through research grants or fellowships that embed graduate students or postdocs with our team to work on specific extensions (like the OLG model or health insurance dynamics). These partnerships also raise our profile in the academic community, leading to citations in papers and greater trust in PolicyEngine’s methodologies. We will continue presenting at conferences (as we did at NTA, APPAM, etc. in 2024) to stay connected with the latest research and showcase our developments.

- **Government and Think Tank Collaboration:** We aim to work closely with government offices and think tanks on pilot projects. For instance, if a state budget office wants to evaluate a new tax credit, our team could assist them in using PolicyEngine for that, learning what features or data might be missing for state-level analysis. Similarly, we might partner with a think tank to produce a public report on some policy, combining their policy expertise with our modeling. These joint efforts both demonstrate PolicyEngine’s value and help improve the tool via real-world use. One example is our work supported by Arnold Ventures: they leveraged PolicyEngine US to analyze interactions between the SALT deduction and the AMT, resulting in the **SALTernative** tool. The generous support of such funders not only finances specific improvements (like adding full state tax detail) but also signals to others that PolicyEngine is a credible, high-impact platform. Going forward, maintaining and growing these relationships – with funders like Arnold, Nuffield (in the UK), and new ones such as Gates Foundation or Rockefeller Foundation – will be key to scaling our impact. We will identify mutual goals with each partner: e.g. a foundation focused on economic mobility might fund the expansion of our benefit modeling, while an environmental funder might sponsor the addition of emissions modeling.

- **User Support and Training:** As our user base grows, we recognize the need for robust support and documentation. We are bolstering our documentation (tutorials, examples, FAQs) and considering a community forum or Slack/Discord where users can ask questions and share knowledge. Our team will dedicate effort to prompt support, especially for partner organizations using the API or conducting analyses. Additionally, we plan to create **certification or training programs** – for example, a short course on “PolicyEngine for Policy Analysts” that could be offered online or at partner universities. By empowering users with knowledge, we not only enhance their experience but also turn them into advocates and contributors. We envision an expanding network of **PolicyEngine “power users”** across think tanks and agencies who help evangelize the tool in their circles. This grassroots growth complements the top-down partnerships and is crucial for long-term sustainability of the project’s community.

## Team and Organizational Growth

To execute this strategy, PolicyEngine will build out its team over the next three years, growing from a **10-person startup** into a more structured organization of potentially 30-40 staff. The future **org chart** will likely be organized around our three core functions – modeling, product/engineering, and research – with close collaboration among them:

- **Data & Modeling Team:** This team is responsible for the development of the microsimulation models and data pipelines. We anticipate hiring a **Chief Economist** (or Head of Modeling) to lead the economic content and methodology, alongside our existing data science lead. In fact, our current data science contractor (a PhD statistician from Google) who spearheaded the district-level modeling project could transition into a **Chief Data Scientist** role. Under their leadership, we’d have a group of economists, data scientists, and analysts. Some would specialize by domain – for example, one might focus on tax policy modeling, another on social benefits, another on health and pensions. Others would focus on core data tasks like maintaining and extending our synthetic datasets (e.g. building the 75-year panel, or integrating new survey data releases) and ensuring the calibration of results. We will also allocate roles for **quality assurance and validation** – essentially team members who double-check that policy changes are implemented correctly and that results make sense relative to external benchmarks. By having both economists and data scientists in one team, we ensure that substantive accuracy and technical rigor go hand in hand when expanding the model.

- **Engineering and Product Team:** This team builds and maintains the software platform – everything from the back-end engine and API to the front-end web application. We plan to bring on a **Chief Technology Officer (CTO)** to oversee the technical strategy and architecture. Under the CTO, there would be software engineers focused on different components: front-end developers improving the web UI/UX, back-end engineers optimizing the simulation engine and API, and **DevOps engineers** managing cloud infrastructure and deployment (ensuring uptime and scalability). We also foresee hiring **UX/UI designers** to make the application intuitive, as well as possibly a **data engineer** to manage our databases and data pipelines (overlapping with the modeling team’s needs). Given our emphasis on AI features, having a machine learning engineer or prompting specialist could be valuable as well, possibly within this team. The engineering team will work closely with the modeling team – for instance, implementing new algorithms for parallel processing or integrating the microimpute/calibration libraries into the production pipeline – and with the research team to incorporate user feedback. As the platform grows, this team ensures that PolicyEngine remains **fast, reliable, and user-friendly**.

- **Policy Research and Outreach Team:** Distinct from the core model builders, this team will focus on applying the model for analysis, producing reports, and engaging with external users. We envision a **Director of Policy Research** (or Chief Policy Analyst) leading this group. Team members would include policy analysts and economists who can interpret simulation results, draft policy reports, and communicate findings in accessible ways. They will be the ones, for example, writing analysis like the recent report on federal tax proposals, or responding to requests from partners (“what does our model say about this new bill’s impact on poverty?”). This team also covers outreach: a **Community Manager or Outreach Coordinator** might be in charge of organizing workshops, managing collaborations, and fielding inquiries from potential users. Some staff might split roles between research and outreach – e.g. a policy analyst who also helps train think tank users on how to use the software. Importantly, this team serves as a bridge between the technology and the outside world, ensuring that **user needs and policy questions drive our development**. They also generate content (blog posts, briefings, presentations) that showcases PolicyEngine’s capabilities, thereby attracting new users and funders.

- **Operations and Partnerships:** As we grow, we will need personnel for operational support and relationship management. This could eventually form another division, but in the near term, these functions might be handled by the leadership and a few key hires. A **Head of Partnerships or Business Development** could focus on funder relationships, strategic partnerships (with foundations, agencies, or companies), and exploring international expansion opportunities. We will also strengthen operations by hiring in areas like finance (grant reporting, budgeting) and possibly HR or administrative support as the team hits a certain size. These roles ensure the organization runs smoothly and that the core teams can focus on product and research. Given PolicyEngine’s nonprofit nature, a lot of this effort will go into grant management and reporting, maintaining open-source governance, and coordinating across the US, UK, and any new country teams. By the three-year mark, having a small but effective ops team will be crucial to sustain our growth.

In an ideal fully-funded scenario, these teams would report up to the CEO (currently the co-founder) or possibly a **Chief Product Officer** if one is brought in to align cross-team efforts. But initially, a flatter structure with leads of Modeling, Engineering, and Research all reporting to the CEO can work well to maintain agility. The key is fostering a culture of collaboration: the modelers, coders, and analysts must work in tandem to deliver on our mission.

## Funding and Sustainability

Executing this strategy will require a corresponding growth in funding. PolicyEngine is committed to remaining an **open-source nonprofit platform**, which means our revenue model will blend **philanthropic funding with mission-aligned earned income**. Here’s how we plan to sustain and scale our operations financially:

- **Philanthropic Grants:** Grants from foundations and philanthropic initiatives are a primary funding source, especially for building core capabilities that benefit the public. We have already received support from funders like **Arnold Ventures, NEO Philanthropy, the Gerald Huff Fund for Humanity, PSL Foundation, and Corvus Oaks Foundation**. These grants have enabled much of our progress to date (e.g., Arnold’s support funded our SALTernative tool, and Nuffield Foundation supported UK model enhancements). Going forward, we will seek additional grants aligned with various aspects of our work: for example, a foundation focused on economic security might fund the expansion of our safety net modeling; a tech philanthropy might fund our open-source infrastructure (the NSF POSE grant is along these lines); a climate-focused funder could support the integration of emissions impacts. We will also pursue large-scale grants to support our **community building** and international expansion, positioning PolicyEngine as a global public good. In three years, we anticipate an annual budget on the order of **\$5+ million**, a significant portion of which would ideally come from multi-year foundation grants to provide stability.

- **Government and Academic Contracts:** We have begun to generate revenue through contracts with academic and government-affiliated entities that use PolicyEngine for specific projects. For instance, our collaborations with universities (Georgetown/Michigan, USC) involve funded contracts. As our credibility grows, we may secure contracts or MOUs with government agencies – for example, a state government might pay us to develop a module for a new program, or a federal statistical agency could contract us to improve survey-based tax calculations. These contracts not only provide revenue but also further entrench PolicyEngine in the policy analysis infrastructure. We will remain careful to avoid mission drift – taking on projects that fit within our broader roadmap – and we will ensure any improvements funded this way remain open source for others to benefit. Such arrangements demonstrate a path to **public-sector support** for open analytical tools.

- **API and Premium Services:** While the core PolicyEngine tools will stay free, open, and accessible, we see potential in offering **value-added services for revenue**. One avenue is an API subscription for heavy users (e.g. a large nonprofit or company integrating our API extensively might pay for a higher usage tier with guaranteed support and uptime SLAs). Another is a **“Pro” version of the web platform** for institutional users: this could include advanced features like collaborative workspaces, bulk scenario processing, priority access to new AI capabilities, or white-label options. For example, if an accounting firm wants to run thousands of client scenarios or use our platform with enhanced privacy and support, a paid enterprise plan could be offered. Any such monetization will be designed carefully so as not to undermine the open nature – likely it would be charging for _compute resources and convenience_ rather than for data or code. Over three years, these earned-income streams could become a significant part of the budget, potentially covering a notable fraction (e.g. 20-30% or more) of annual costs if uptake is strong. They also increase our resilience by diversifying funding.

- **Consulting and Support Services:** Relatedly, because PolicyEngine’s software is open-source, another revenue opportunity is **consulting services** to help organizations implement or extend it. For instance, a country that wants to adopt PolicyEngine for its own tax-benefit system might hire us to assist with that process. Or a nonprofit using our microdata and tools might pay for training workshops for their staff. We have expertise in niche technical areas (like machine learning imputations and data calibration) that many organizations need – our plan is to share that expertise freely via open code, but for those who lack capacity to implement it, we could provide paid support. This model is similar to how some open-source companies sustain themselves (offering paid support for free software). While we don’t expect consulting to be a huge focus, it can help cover specific projects and strengthen relationships that lead to other funding.

- **Budget Projections:** Combining these sources, we anticipate scaling our budget significantly to support the 30+ person team and technical infrastructure. A rough projection for year 3 might be around **\$5–6 million** annually. This would likely break down as: roughly half for personnel (competitive salaries to attract and retain the talent described in our team plan), perhaps 15–20% for cloud infrastructure and AI/API costs (which will rise as usage grows), and the remainder for other operating costs (events, travel for conferences and training, office/admin, etc.). We will continuously seek efficiency – leveraging volunteer contributions and in-kind support where possible (for example, cloud credits from providers, or university partnerships that offset data costs). By maintaining a mix of funding, we aim to avoid over-reliance on any single source. Our nonprofit status also allows us to reinvest any surplus into further development, and we’ll maintain financial transparency to retain funder confidence.

In summary, sustainability for PolicyEngine will come from a **hybrid model**: core grant funding for public-good development, augmented by earned revenue from those who derive significant private value (and can pay for enhanced service). This approach ensures we don’t put basic features behind a paywall – aligning with our mission of openness – while still capturing funding to grow and innovate.

## Conclusion and Outlook

PolicyEngine’s strategy is to become a **unified, open platform for policy innovation**, combining state-of-the-art modeling, broad policy coverage, and user-focused technology. By executing on the plans outlined – expanding our data/modeling infrastructure, covering more policies and geographies, enhancing our platform with AI and collaborative tools, and engaging a wide community of users – we will dramatically increase the impact of PolicyEngine in the coming years. Success will mean that a diverse set of stakeholders can answer complex policy questions _in minutes_ rather than months, with full transparency and rigor. Whether it’s a researcher evaluating a nationwide reform, a local official tweaking a program for their county, or a family figuring out what benefits they can get, PolicyEngine will be there to provide answers grounded in evidence and data.

Crucially, we are doing this in an **inclusive and open way**. By democratizing access to policy analysis, we help level the playing field between well-resourced decision makers and the public at large. A world where policy decisions are guided by transparent, verifiable evidence – rather than guesswork or limited proprietary analysis – is a world where better outcomes are possible for everyone. PolicyEngine is building towards that world, and our next three-year phase is about scaling up to meet the challenge. With continued support from funders, collaborators, and our growing user community, we are confident that PolicyEngine will become an essential infrastructure for data-driven policy making, much like a “public utility” for policy analysis. Each new feature, each new user, and each new partnership will further solidify PolicyEngine’s role in creating a future where policy is not just debated, but **designed with evidence** – truly fulfilling our mission to **generate evidence for better policy**.
